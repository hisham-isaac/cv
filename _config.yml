about_content: "I’m a self-professed geek, with a varied interest that includes; Technology, Entrepreneurship, Economics, Physical activity and nutrition, to mention a few. I would best be described as someone who’s incisively curious about life in general, however small or insignificant the element. I believe that this gives me a rounded approach to learning, and helps me to draw links and parallels between topics that have little in common in order to come up with innovative solution, when trying to solve larger complex problems."
